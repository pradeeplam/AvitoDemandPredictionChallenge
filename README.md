# AvitoDemandPredictionChallenge
Kaggle Competition where the goal was to predict the probability a product would sell on "Russia's Craigslist"

First Kaggle competition in which I've participated!

Most of the work was data clearning (w/ some feature engineering) and then everything 
was plugged into a Gradient Boosted Tree Model.
